Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.

Rainbow is an example of literal characters. Meta characters make up regular expressions

\d -> means any digit 0 through 9

\w -> A through Z, a through z, and it could be 0 through 9

\s -> any white space

\W -> anything thats NOT a word character

\S -> anything thats NOT a whitespace


quantifier:
. -> any character

* -> 0 or more

Usually used  as .*

+ -> 1 or more

? -> 0 or 1

{min, max} -> a minimum or maximum


position:
^ -> beginning

$ -> end

\b -> word boundary which is usually used as \b ... \b

character classes:
[abc] -> means a OR b OR c
[-.] -> - OR .
[a-z] -> a through z, - is a special character that needs to be the first thing if you want to search for a literal dash
[^a-z] -> not a through z

Alternation: 
(net|com) -> net OR com

Grouping:
Adding paranthesis to part of the expression to then later replace or use

ex. (\d{3}) 

$0 -> everything

$1 -> \d{3}
